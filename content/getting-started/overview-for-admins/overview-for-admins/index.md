### Concepts

#### Organization

MailRoute's organizational structure follows this pattern:

    
    
        Customer
          Domain
            Email Account (Mailbox)
    

A **Customer** has one or more **Domains**. A **Domain** has one or more
**Email Accounts** associated with it.

As a **Customer Admin** , you're in control of all your domains and all your
mailboxes. An admin can add or remove domains and change their email delivery
settings, add and edit Allow/Block lists, default filter and notification
settings. They can add or remove mailboxes, set their per-mailbox settings,
and view their individual email quarantines. You can make all these changes
through the MailRoute Control Panel at
[https://admin.mailroute.net](https://admin.mailroute.net/), or via our
[API](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-us/sections/205312008-API).

### The MailRoute Control Panel

#### Logging In

Once you've signed up for MailRoute, you're provided with an administrative
login for the MailRoute Control Panel via email. Visit
[https://admin.mailroute.net](https://admin.mailroute.net/) and login with
your email address and password.

**See** **[this article](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/224060948-Creating-a-Login-with-MailRoute)** for step-by-step
**login** instructions.

#### Navigating the Control Panel

The options at the top of the **Control Pane** l provide quick access to all
your **Customers** , **Domains** , and **Email Accounts**.

In addition, if your login email is also on a domain that is filtered by
MailRoute, you can access your own personal Quarantine and your individual
mailbox settings.
