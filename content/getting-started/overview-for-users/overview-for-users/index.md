## **What is MailRoute?**

**MailRoute is a service that sits between your emailbox and the rest of the
world. It filters spam and viruses out of your email; bad mail is deleted,
suspicious mail is quarantined, and clean mail is delivered.**

As an end-user, you can simply sit back and enjoy the safe and secure spam and
virus free email environment that your email system administrators have
created for you.

## **[Quarantine Notifications](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/224061408)**

From within this email notification you can view a list of new mail in your
quarantine. You can view each item, Recover mail from quarantine so that it is
delivered to your mailbox, or Allow and Recover it.

Allow means that mail from that domain or mailbox will always be allowed
through to you and will not be filtered (except for viruses).

We recommend not having Allow lists of major or popular domains (like banks,
etc) or freemail domains such yahoo, gmail, hotmail etc as it allows forged
emails through no matter how spammy they are.

The frequency of notifications can be set to individual needs; e.g. hourly,
daily, twice weekly. Keep in mind that the notifications are only sent if
there is new mail received.

## **Using My MailRoute Account**

Login to your MailRoute account
[here](https://admin.mailroute.net/accounts/login). If you don’t know your
password, you can request a new one by clicking the link “Create a new

Most users will find that the standard filter settings suit them perfectly,
but if you have specific needs or want to tweak the settings, you can easily
customize the filtering.
