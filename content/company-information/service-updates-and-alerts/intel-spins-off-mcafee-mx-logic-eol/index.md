MailRoute has always had respect for MX Logic and we're sorry to watch their
fate as Intel "rids itself of its McAfee experiment." Read more[ here.

MX Logic is a good company. We remember when they started (after we started
FrontBridge and Postini came on the scene). It's been tough to watch these
good companies get gobbled up by larger entities and then either used to push
their hard-earned customers onto the larger entity's platform, or -- in the
case of MX Logic -- shut down altogether.

It is becoming more difficult for SME's to find reliable, responsive service
providers.

This is MailRoute's raison d'etre. Learn more about our commitment to our
