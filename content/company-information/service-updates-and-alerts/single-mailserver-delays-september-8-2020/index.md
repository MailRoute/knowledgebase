title: Single Mailserver Delays - September 8, 2020
---


A single mailserver in our Los Angeles data center has been flooded with spam
from a large and previously trusted sender which has caused a backlog of the
regular processing of email. We have removed all of the mail from this sender
and our mailservers are processing the queued mail.

All mail has been processed and delivered as of 10:35am PST.
