  1. Log in to your account at [eurodns.com](https://my.eurodns.com/login).
  2. Go to **DOMAIN NAMES** > **ACTIVE**.
  3. Move the cursor over the domain you want to edit and click on **Manage** on the right.
  4. In the Name Servers section, click on **Manage Zone**.
  5. Select **MX** (Mail Exchanger) in the **Add DNS Record** dropdown menu.

** If you have one or more records in the MAIL EXCHANGER table (these are your
existing MX records), click on the **Delete** link relative to that record.

6\. In the **Mail Server** field add the mail server name:
**_mail.mailroute.net._** (be sure to include the trailing dot “.”!)

8\. Confirm and click on **Save Changes**.

**Note:** DNS changes usually need up to 24 hours to propagate throughout the
