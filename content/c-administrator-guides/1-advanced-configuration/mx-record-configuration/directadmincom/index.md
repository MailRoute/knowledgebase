## MX Record Configuration: DirectAdmin

  1. Login to [DirectAdmin](https://directadmin.com/).
  2. Make sure you are on the **User Level**.
  3. Select the domain you want to edit the MX record for (If you only have one domain on your account, you don't need to do this step).
  4. Click on **MX Records** under the **E-Mail Management** section.
  5. Select any MX Records that are there, and then click **delete**.
  6. Put **mail.mailroute.net.** in the text box, and select **10** in the drop-down box. Click **Add**. (Be sure to have the trailing dot "." where it says "mail.mairoute.net"!).

NOTE:

** If you do not have the MX Records menu in your DirectAdmin User Level
login, then ask your hosting provider to enable the DNS Control option for
your account.
