## To update MX records

    1. Log in to [**Account Manager**](https://www.networksolutions.com/manage-it/index.jsp).
    2. Within **Account Manager,** use the drop down under **My Domain Names** to choose the domain you’d like to manage and click the **Go** button.
    3. In the green box, select **Change Where Domain Points.**
    4. Select **Advanced DNS.**
    5. Click the **Continue** button.
    6. If the domain name was not previously pointed to Network Solutions® nameservers (DNS) you will receive a page with messaging regarding this change. If you’d like to continue, click the **Move Nameservers to Network Solutions®** button.
    7. In the **Mail Servers (MX Records)** section, click **Edit MX Records.**
    8. Your current MX records are listed in editable form, and any Network Solutions® service that is associated with the MX record is listed under the Mail Server text box.

## To add/edit MX records:

1\. Enter _**mail.mailroute.net**_ in the **Mail Server text box** and its
associated priority number - Enter: **1** in the **Priority text** **box**

2\. Click **Continue.**

##

## To delete MX records:

1\. To the right of the MX record, select the check box in the **Delete**
column.  
2\. Click **Continue**.  
  

## Final Steps:

1\. **Review** the list of requested changes.

2\. Click **Continue**. Your new MX records will be displayed in the middle of
the page.

**Note** : The change may take up to several hours to update, so you may not
receive new email messages via MailRoute immediately. Until then, if you have
been using another service for your email, you'll continue to receive messages
at your old email provider.

If you see a MX records setup validation in progress message on the Domains
page for more than a few hours, check to make sure the MX record values and
priority have been correctly entered in your domain host.
