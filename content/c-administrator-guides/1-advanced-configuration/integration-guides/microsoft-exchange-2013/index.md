## Before you configure the connectors:

## 1\. Make sure that under the Delivery in the MailRoute Control Panel,
select Outbound Servers. Enter the IP addresses of each of your email servers.

2\. Set your [SPF For Outbound](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/360021568194-Implementing-SPF-for-the-MailRoute-Outbound-
SmartHost-Service).

3\. Set up [DKIM](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/115009100687-Implementing-DKIM-for-the-MailRoute-Outbound-
SmartHost-Service), [ADSP and DMARC](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/360062946093-Implementing-DMARC-for-the-MailRoute-Outbound-
SmartHost-Service).

**NOTE** : add the address range: 199.89.0.0 - 199.89.7.255 in Step #5  
  
Use the EAC to Create a Receive Connector to Receive Secure Messages from a
Partner

  1. In the EAC, navigate to **Mail flow** > **Receive connectors**. Click **Add** to create a new Receive connector.
  2. On the **New receive connector** page, specify a name for the Receive connector and then select **Frontend Transport** for the **Role**. Since you are receiving mail from a partner in this case, we recommend that you initially route mail to your front end server to simplify and consolidate your mail flow.
  3. Choose **Partner** for the type. The Receive connector will receive mail from a trusted third party.
  4. For the **Network adapter bindings** , observe that **All available IPV4** is listed in the **IP addresses** list and the **Port** is 25. (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol uses port 25.) This indicates that the connector listens for connections on all IP addresses assigned to network adapters on the local server. Click **Next**.
  5. If the Remote network settings page lists 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255, which means that the Receive connector receives connections from all IP addresses, click **Remove** to remove it. Click **Add** , add the IP address for your partnerâ€™s server, and click **Save**.
  6. Add the address range: 199.89.0.0 - 199.89.7.255
  7. Click **Finish** to create the connector.
  8. Once you have created the Receive connector, it appears in the Receive connector list. If you would like to see an example of how to create a Receive connector with a cmdlet, see [New-ReceiveConnector](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb125139%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx). <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj673037%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx>

* While logged in to the EAC, you must also select to allow "Anonymous users"

Go to: EAC > Mail Flow > Receive connectors > edit Client Frontend, the role
of FrontendTransport, "Exchange Receive Connector" window will pop up. In this
window: Security > Checkbox "Anonymous users" and Save

**NOTE** : Content Filters and Sender IDs need to be disabled on the Exchange
server. If the server's mail traffic is filtered by MailRoute, it is not
necessary to keep them enabled.
