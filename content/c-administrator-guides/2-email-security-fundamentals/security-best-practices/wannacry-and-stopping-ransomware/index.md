Ransomware, Malware, Phishing, Spoofing

These terms are being used more frequently, in a month that has already
brought a widespread [phishing
attack](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/03/technology/google-docs-phishing-
attack/) on Google Docs users and now a ransomware attack,
[WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack), that has
reportedly affected 230,000 computers in 150 countries.
