# Are you prepared for GDPR?

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) takes effect May 25, 2018, and is
designed to unify data privacy requirements across the European Union. If you
market to or process the information of EU data subjects – including end-
users, customers and employees – you need to know that your data partners and
vendors are compliant.  

Following extensive auditing and training, we can confirm that MailRoute's
services meet these criteria and we are GDPR compliant (just as we're HIPAA
and ITAR compliant here in the U.S.).  

MailRoute does not do anything creepy with your email, like sell your content
to marketing firms or track your data for any outside purposes. We expire all
quarantined and archived mail within an agreed-upon timeframe, set by you, and
do not share anything about your account with any outside services.  

You'd be amazed how few providers can say that these days.  

MailRoute's team created the first-ever hosted email filters (FrontBridge
circa 1997), and we've done this longer and better than anyone else.

We're in this business to protect you and your data. Period.
