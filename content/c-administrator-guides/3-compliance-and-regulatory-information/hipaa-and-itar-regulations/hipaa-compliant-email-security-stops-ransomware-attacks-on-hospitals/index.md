title: HIPAA-compliant Email Security Stops Ransomware Attacks on Hospitals

## CISA, FBI and HHS warn of Ransomware attacks on Healthcare. MailRoute stops
those attacks.

LOS ANGELES (PRWEB) DECEMBER 03, 2020

On October 29, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) warned of an increased, imminent threat to
U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers.

The agencies have credible information that malicious cyber actors are
targeting the healthcare and public health sectors with malware that can
result in ransomware attacks, disruption of healthcare services and data
theft.

Protective measures to prevent ransomware attacks often include alerting
employees to be vigilant with respect to phishing attempts. This “people-
centric approach” touted by most data security services is simply a way of
saying the onus is on the end-user. This appears to be an abdication of
responsibility by paid services who are employed to protect their clients.
When reassessing an entity’s essential cyber incident response plan, it is
imperative to include a HIPAA-compliant gateway security service.

To protect clinicians and patients from targeted threats and ensure data is
HIPAA compliant requires a gateway security service, which sits outside the
network and functions as the first, and most stringent, line of defense
against malicious attacks.

“These targeted ransomware attacks are being waged on hospitals and healthcare
facilities because those entities retain data valuable to bad actors as well
as the monetary gain from paid ransom,” explains MailRoute founder and CEO
Thomas Johnson.

“Finding a HIPAA-compliant security service is difficult, because they must
meet the stringent standards of the Federal government as relates to email
handling, including legitimate encryption and storage timeframes on a vendor’s
network.

“Companies that focus on myriad data services often cannot meet these
standards, since they use third-party encryption services that are less robust
than required. MailRoute focuses on a core competency of email security, so we
are compliant on all levels,” Johnson concludes.

A gateway service eliminates heightened security risks, should have API-level
integration and should work with all email platforms and servers. MailRoute’s
cloud-based email filtering solution, for example, stops unwanted inbound
emails and potential attacks before they ever reach mail servers. Outbound
monitoring also blocks confidential files from leaving a client's network.

Cyber Threat Protection  
Virtual healthcare is becoming the new normal with the continual increase in
the use of web-based mobile apps between doctors and patients and the
resulting electronic health records stored in a virtual black hole. Because
medical records contain the most lucrative data for hackers to sell on the
black market, cyber-attacks on healthcare systems continue to grow.

Email Compliance  
While it is critical that hospitals and healthcare facilities meet HIPAA
compliance regulations, it’s also important to streamline compliance and
regulatory processes for IT teams by using a reliable, efficient and secure
gateway service to stop malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, and other spam
and viruses.
