Many MailRoute reseller-partners have their customers on our grandfathered
Legacy plan, which means they are not on [Basics, Enterprise or
Compliance](https://mailroute.net/pages/pricing) (GCC High or other). This
means that your Legacy and Basics customers must pay an additional charge for
Continuity.

However, Continuity is an included feature in our Enterprise plan. This
creates an opportunity to improve your customers' experience by either selling
them Continuity as an add-on feature or upgrade their plan to Enterprise for
an added fee.

Below is a marketing email sent by MailRoute reseller Island Technologies that
can be referenced as an example.

If you have questions about marketing MailRoute plans and features, please
contact [sales@mailroute.net](mailto:sales@mailroute.net) and you'll be routed
to our reseller account experts.

We want to let you know about an awesome new service we’re recommending for
all clients. It’s an easy, inexpensive, and powerful tool for preventing email
outages. We’ve adopted the technology for our own business and already seen
how powerful it can be. We think you should, too.

So, what is it? The service is called **MailRoute Email Continuity**.
Basically, what it does is it takes your email uptime to the next level. It’s
more than a backup. When added on to your Island Email account, **MailRoute
Email Continuity allows you to receive new email even when the servers are
down**.

You read that right. There’s now a way you can keep receiving emails even when
your email would otherwise be “down.”

Having provided email services to clients for over a decade, we know how an
email outage at the wrong time can really throw a wrench into things. We’ve
seen projects stall, overtime hours stack up, and deadlines get missed. All
because of email outages. These are the types of issues that MailRoute Email
Continuity helps overcome.

If you’re ready to get started, go ahead and send an email or a call. For
existing Island Email accounts it’s as simple as letting us know that you’d
like to upgrade your domain with Mailroute Email Continuity. With Mailroute
Email Continuity you’ll enjoy:

  * Drastically reduce email downtime
  * Instant setup for existing Island Email accounts
  * Low cost of $2 per month per account

If you don’t yet have an Island Email account, we encourage you to learn more
[here](https://islandtechnologies.cmail20.com/t/y-l-xdludn-dhhruljyji-j/). If
you’ve never experienced the difference you get with a premium email service
for your business, it’s worth it.

As always, please reach out with any questions. We look forward to working
with you this year!

  
Thank you,  
 **—Team Island**
