### Who We Are

MailRoute was founded in 2002 by Thomas Johnson to set new standards in email
protection services. Johnson and his technology team developed MailRoute's
multi-layered solution to be highly efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.
Headquartered in Manhattan Beach, CA, MailRoute offers email protection
services to corporate, governmental, and educational customers. The executive
team at MailRoute includes Mark Tennenbaum and Rachel Plecas, part of the team
who created Microsoft's Forefront. Each executive brings decades of strategic
development experience to the company, which is privately funded. MailRoute

### Our Philosophy

Customer Support is not simply a department at MailRoute: it is our culture.
“The customer comes first” may be an established adage, but it’s truly the way
we do business – personal phone calls, first-name relationships with our
customers, and an average response-time of minutes for Level 1 customer
support. MailRoute understands that email is the lifeline of most businesses,
and our focus is singular: to provide knowledgeable, reliable customer service
that results in the delivery of clean email.
