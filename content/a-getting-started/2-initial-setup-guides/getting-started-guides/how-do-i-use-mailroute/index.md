## Using MailRoute’s Email Protection Services

__

### What is MailRoute?

MailRoute is a service that sits between your emailbox and the rest of the
world. It filters spam and viruses out of your email; bad mail is deleted,
suspicious mail is quarantined, and clean mail is delivered. You can view your
quarantine by logging into your MailRoute account or by reviewing a quarantine
notification email that will arrive in your mailbox.

### [Quarantine Notifications](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/articles/224061408)

From within this email notification you can view a list of new mail in your
quarantine. You can view each item and delete it, release it from quarantine
so that it is delivered to your mailbox, or Allow and release it. Allow means
that mail from that domain or mailbox will always be allowed through to you.
You can also Block senders and domains from within your MailRoute account.

### Using My MailRoute Account

Login to your MailRoute account
[here](https://admin.mailroute.net/accounts/login). If you don’t know your
password, you can request a new one by clicking the link “Create a new
password”.
