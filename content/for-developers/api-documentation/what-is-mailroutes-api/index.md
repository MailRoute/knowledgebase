title: What is MailRoute's API?

[What is an
API?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "API
Definition")

MailRoute's API makes it possible to tie all sorts of pieces -- like outside
applications (like webmail clients), your own billing system, and mailbox
lists and preferences -- in with our Control Panel, to automate account
management.

For example, if your webmail users write rules to auto Allow or Block, your
users can keep doing things just the way they have been doing them all along
-- even after joining MailRoute. When they update an Allow/Block entry on your
webmail client, it can update in our system as well.

If you have in-house programming talent, you can use our documentation and
libraries to implement this quite simply. If you don't, it's something that we
can probably do for you.

Our APIs are all documented at
[https://support.mailroute.net/forums/21682281-API](https://support.mailroute.net/hc/en-
us/sections/205312008-API)

And we have libraries for all the common web-programming languages (php,
python, ruby) at <http://github.com/mailroute>
