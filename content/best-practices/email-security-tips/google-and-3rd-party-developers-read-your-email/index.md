title: Google and 3rd-party developers read your email
---


Free mail users have long accepted some practices that seem -- to us -- rather
horrifying.

As more businesses accept gSuite or Google Apps as a legit way to handle their
professional email correspondence, MailRoute encourages you to consider your
data security. A third-party gateway filtering service won't solve the problem
of Google reading your mail, but we can offer robust, alternative protection.
