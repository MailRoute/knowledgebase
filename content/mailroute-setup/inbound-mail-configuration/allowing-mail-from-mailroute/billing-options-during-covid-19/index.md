title: Billing Options During COVID-19
---


Are you working remotely right now? We want to help by making things as simple
as possible for our customers through this challenging time.

Some have requested to use our ACH payment option, rather than mail a signed
company check.

**You can switch payment options at any time.**

**Please email[billing@mailroute.net](mailto:billing@mailroute.net) to obtain
our ACH details for your bank or check your invoice for "Ways To Pay".**

Please let us know how else we can help you with remote-working assistance,
billing assistance or whatever else you might need to meet your business-email
needs.
