title: Nov. 2, 2013 - CryptoLocker filtering
---


As of October 17th, at 19:27 GMT, and again through daily updates, we are
blocking all versions of CryptoLocker Ransomware (it has many different
names).

MailRoute uses several anti-virus engines and switches regularly to those
which are working best at the time. These are updated every 5 minutes.

Additionally, we filter any message that contains a zip file; we check the
message but also open the zip and check contents.

Please contact support@mailroute.net for more information.
