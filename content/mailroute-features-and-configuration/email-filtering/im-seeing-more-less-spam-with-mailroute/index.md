## MailRoute New Customers

Some MailRoute customers notice a significant difference in their mail volume
after activating their MailRoute account. Some see much more mail that they
consider to be spam, others see far less mail in their Quarantine.

This article will outline the improved accuracy of MailRoute over other
services, to explain why you're seeing a difference.

### MailRoute uses Adaptive Blocklisting

If you're seeing less mail in your Quarantine, congratulations! You're
benefiting from MailRoute's first level of defense. We stop the most egregious
spam at the very outer layer of filtering, which means you have less garbage
to sift through in your Quarantine. Some other services pass this through to
their customers, but MailRoute doesn't want to waste your time with mail from
known, blocked spammers. Our intial layer of filtering stops 80% or more of
unwanted mail traffic, so that you don't have to sort through it in your
Quarantine.

### Ham vs Spam - MailRoute **hates hates hates** false positives

If you're seeing more mail volume in your inbox, these are probably opt-in
marketing messages that you signed up for when you bought that widget online
as birthday gift for your mom. Didn't uncheck that box that says "Yes, send me
product news and updates"? Well, you're getting product news and updates. And
you know what? MailRoute doesn't consider this spam!

At MailRoute, we talk about **Consent** vs **Content**. Blocking these
messages from delivery to you would be a false-positive, in filtering
parlance, and we don't like those. You can either unsubscribe to these
messages or block the domain that's sending them.

You may have heard in the past that "clicking the _unsubscribe_ link in an
email just lets a spammer know someone is there, and that you'll get a flood
of new spam as a result". But MailRoute filters out those kinds of spammers -
anything that's making it into your inbox with an unsubscribe link is almost
certainly a company with legitimate and well-managed opt-in email policies. If
it makes it to your inbox, then you should be able to safely unsubscribe. And
if the company doesn't honor your wishes, let us know! We'll have a talk with
them and straighten them out.
