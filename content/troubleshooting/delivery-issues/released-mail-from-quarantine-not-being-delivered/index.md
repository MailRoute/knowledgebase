title: Released Mail from Quarantine not Being Delivered
---


"I released an email from Quarantine and it didn't arrive in my
inbox/mailbox."

If this is happening to you, you're not alone. This is the number-one question
from our customers: "Where is my released email? It never showed up!"

We hesitate to say "100% of the time", so 99% of the time, **the issue is with
additional filtering**.

If MailRoute thought the mail looked suspicious and placed it in your
quarantine folder, then it's likely someone else will think it looks spammy or
like a virus too.

Please check for any other filtering on your system: Does your email host
provide some form of filtering? Is there filtering on your email server, or
your desktop? If so, the email is probably in there.

If you cannot find the mail, let us know and we'll confirm that the mail was
indeed released from your quarantine and delivered to your server, but we
cannot control what happens to it once we complete our secure delivery of your
mail.

We're always here to help, 24/7: support@mailroute.net or submit a ticket
through the help desk at support.mailroute.net.

Thank you for using MailRoute!
