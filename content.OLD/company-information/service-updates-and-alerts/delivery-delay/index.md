MailRoute typically processes mail in a second or two, but today we noticed a
few more seconds than normal. Most customers probably won't see a difference,
but we did, so we looked into the issue and resolved it about 10 minutes ago.

If you have questions about this, or about our service and features, please
contact us at [support@mailroute.net ](mailto:support@mailroute.net)or
888.485.7726. We have humans who answer the phone over here :)

Thanks for choosing MailRoute!
