title: Oct. 15, 2014 - MailRoute users protected against POODLE
---


### All MailRoute services are patched and protected, and we are not
susceptible to this vulnerability.

The recently discovered POODLE vulnerability is an exposed weakness in the
design of SSL version 3.0.

This vulnerability allows the plaintext of secure connections to be calculated
by a network attacker.  
  
"SSL 3.0 is nearly 18 years old, but support for it remains widespread. Most
importantly, nearly all browsers support it and, in order to work around bugs
in HTTPS servers, browsers will retry failed connections with older protocol
versions, including SSL 3.0. Because a network attacker can cause connection
failures, they can trigger the use of SSL 3.0 and then exploit this issue."

[This article ](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html)goes
into more detail about POODLE and its threats.

**All MailRoute users are protected and our systems are secure.**
