title: MS Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities are being exploited
---


We are receiving reports of customers with compromised MS Exchange servers.

exchange-servers/>

  
Latest news indicates that “cyber espionage operations using the SSRF
vulnerability CVE-2021-26855 started occurring on January 3, 2021,”
(<https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-
exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/>)

On March 2, Microsoft released updates for Exchange Server and informed of
“multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on-premises versions of
Microsoft Exchange Server in limited and targeted attacks.”
(<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fixes-actively-
exploited-exchange-zero-day-bugs-patch-now/>)

Due to the severity of the attacks, Microsoft recommends that administrators
"install these updates immediately" to protect Exchange servers from these
attacks.

There is a set of tools from Microsoft for checking and repairing Exchange
servers that have been victim to these exploits:

In addition, it appears that a botnet is using these exploits to mine
crytpcurrency on MS Exchnage servers:

We recommend that all MS Exchange administrators check their servers for these
exploits and install all necessary patches.
