Hello MailRoute Microsoft Office 365 Government/GCC-High Customers!

We are happy to announce that our GCC High Sync App has finally be approved by
Microsoft and is up and running. It meets all the standards and requirements
of the GCC High Office platform, and is part of MailRoute's new NIST 800-171
certification and our ongoing CMMC implementation.

To enable this sync feature, please visit our Control Panel at
[https://admin.mailroute.net](https://admin.mailroute.net/)

Navigate to your GCC High domains, and choose the "Office 365" sync link in
the left-side menu.

Then click the button "Grant permission for MailRoute Sync Application"

This will redirect you to a Microsoft site where you may login with your GCC
High administrator credentials. You'll be asked to give the MailRoute Sync App
read-only permission to access your User and Group lists.

You'll need to give the app permission to access your directory listing of
users and groups.

Once app permissions have been granted you can do a "Manual Sync" of the data
and check it out for accuracy.

Once you are satisfied that everything is correct, you may enter the
"Automatic Synchronization" settings area and set it to run automatically.
