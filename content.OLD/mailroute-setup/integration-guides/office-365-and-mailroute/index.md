Gartner analyst Andrew Lerner [reported](https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-
lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/) that "downtime costs your business
$5,600 per minute, which extrapolates to well over $300,000 per hour." That is
substantially more than it costs to have MailRoute as a reliable layer of
protection, in the face of o365's inherent weaknesses. Downtime is a
significant threat to your business, just as phishing, ransomware or malware
are, and we protect you from all of it.

Office 365's SLA only guarantees 99.9% uptime, while we provide 99.999%
uptime.

**That means Office 365 acknowledges downtime of 44 minutes each month, or 1.5
workdays per year.**

Most Office 365 customers require more advanced security capabilities than
Microsoft can provide. In fact, 18% of our customers are currently using o365
with MailRoute. As the team that created the filtering Microsoft uses for o365
(they bought it from us in 2005), we're well aware of its shortcomings,
because it hasn't been materially updated since they bought it.

For security and productivity, add MailRoute as an essential piece of your
company's business-continuity plan. Enjoy MailRoute's seamless integration
with Office 365 -- and our white-glove migration means we'll even make all of
the necessary records-changes for you.

MailRoute guarantees 100% email availability to your team, for continued
productivity, with our Filtering and our Continuity services.
