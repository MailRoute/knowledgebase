Google announced on June 23, 2015, that their customers now may use other,
better spam filters, and we think that's great!

"Google Apps allows for the use of inbound mail gateway servers which admins
can leverage to process their inbound mail in different ways―such as archiving
it or filtering out spam―before passing it onto the Google Apps mail server
for delivery."
