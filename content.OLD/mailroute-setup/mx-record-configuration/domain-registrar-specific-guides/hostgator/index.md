## MX Record Configuration: HostGator

  1. Log in to your HostGator cPanel account.
  2. In the **Mail** section, click **MX Entry**.
  3. If you have more than one domain, select the domain youâ€™re using with MailRoute - look for this under the **Domain** heading.
  4. Under **Email Routing** , select _ **LOCAL**_ **Mail Exchanger** (PLEASE DO NOT SELECT REMOTE OR AUTO)
  5. Click the **Change** button.
  6. In the **Add New Record** section, create an MX record for MailRoute: 
    * Priority: **1**
    * Destination: **mail.mailroute.net**
  7. Under **MX Records** , note any old MX records, in case you need them later.
  8. Under **MX Records** , delete any original MX records

_________

**PLEASE NOTE** : After adding our mx records it has been reported that the
Mail Exchanger either sets to Auto Detect or Remote. Please be sure to select
**LOCAL MAIL EXCHANGER** and click **CHANGE. You may have to do this more than
once to ensure that the setting sticks.** LOCAL M.E is the only setting that
will allow mail to start flowing correctly.
