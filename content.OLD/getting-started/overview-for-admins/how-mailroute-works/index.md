### How MailRoute Works

MailRoute is the leader in cloud-based email filtering and protection
services.

MailRoute's distributed network of data centers at the “edge” of the Internet
allows us to provide a 99.999% message filtering availability guarantee. In
addition, by dynamically routing incoming and outgoing email to the optimal
network location, we can provide our filtering services with a virtually
undetectable latency time - most messages are processed in less than 2
seconds.

Unlike in-house solutions, which require you to install, manage and maintain
hardware and/or software, the MailRoute system operates on the “edge” of the
Internet, outside your corporate network. MailRoute filters your email traffic
before it enters your network, reducing network and server load, lowering
management issues, and providing a highly effective level of protection.

MailRoute trains its servers in an ongoing fashion, based on constant
monitoring of the ever-changing spam and virus environment. Spam can be sent
to [abuse@mailroute.net](mailto:abuse@mailroute.net) and we use it, among
other things, to update our filters.

You may ask, "Why am I receiving so little spam? With my previous filtering
solution, I had hundreds of pieces of mail in my Quarantine."

MailRoute stops the best known, most egregious spam and viruses outright, and
we don't clog your Quarantine with truly harmful mail from known spammers.
This makes Quarantine management easier for our customers. We also have a very
low false-positive rate.

Users can implement any or all MailRoute services by simply signing up
<http://mailroute.net> and then adjusting the MX (mail exchange) record of
your DNS servers. When an email is sent to your company, the MailRoute DNS
servers analyze the health and performance of the MailRoute network and reply
with the optimal choice. The email enters the MailRoute network and is
analyzed and processed, and passed along to its ultimate destination.

MailRoute Sales offers live online demos as well as comprehensive How To
documents on using our service, stored in our knowledge base library.
