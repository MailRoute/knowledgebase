title: Gmail and Google Rejecting Email with Missing or Incorrect SPF records - March

It appears that Google has increased requirements for email delivery,
particularly with SPF settings. Emails are being rejected from domains that do
not have SPF records or violate SPF.

We recommend checking your SPF and ensuring your settings are correct in order
to improve mail delivery.
