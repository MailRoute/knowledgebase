## How to View Full Headers on Emails

When reporting any issues with emails, whether it's spam or a delivery delay,
it essential that the full headers of emails are sent to Support.

All emails are made up of a header and the body and if you are reporting a
spam problem, sending attachments of both are needed.

Once you have the internet headers and email body, you can email them to us by
sending them as an attachment to
[support@mailroute.net](mailto:support@mailroute.net).
