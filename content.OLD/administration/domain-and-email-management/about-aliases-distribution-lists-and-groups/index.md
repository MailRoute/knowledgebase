title: About Aliases, Distribution Lists and Groups

About aliases, group addresses and/or distribution lists;

You can assign aliases, distribution lists and/or groups as an alias of one
individual and that person would manage the group.

Or you can create a separate (paid) address for each, if you want different
settings or allow/block lists or unique quarantines.

You can also create one paid account that acts as the "master" and make all
the other groups aliases to it. You can choose based on cost or flexibility
just which way would work for you.

Specifically on distribution lists;

If you make a distribution list an alias of an existing user, they'll share
that user's settings and quarantine. Or, if you want distribution lists to
have different settings than any user, you can make (and pay for) one 'user',
and make all the distribution lists as aliases of that.

Keep in mind that checking the distribution lists box only allows filter
settings that match your domain-wide settings. Distribution lists are billable
if customization is required.

**IMPORTANT** : If you are using our newly released **Continuity and Archiving
Lite** service, email directed at aliases will appear in its "parent" address'
mailbox. Aliases do not need to log in to individual mailboxes to view their
email. However, you will need to **avoid aliasing distribution lists.**
Instead **check the distribution box** under the **Email Accounts** tab or
leave it unchecked if you want it treated as a billable account for
customization purposes.

*****NOTE:** Assigning Aliases, Distribution Lists and/or Groups does not
change the flow of your email. It just displays who is responsible for
managing it in our system. If you create a dummy account to assign any of
these to, then the admin or admins would be responsible for managing it by
logging in and viewing the settings and folders.
